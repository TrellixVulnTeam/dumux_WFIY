## Results

The 1p-model calculated a stationary pressure distribution. It is shown in the following figure:

The random permeability distribution generates the velocity profile shown in the left plot of the next figure. The image in the middle illustrates the tracer distribution after 2500s and the image on the right after 5000s.
