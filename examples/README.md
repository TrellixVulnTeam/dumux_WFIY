Examples
===============
The following resources are useful to get started with DuMuX:

 * [Example 1: One phase flow with a tracer model:](https://git.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/dumux-repositories/dumux/tree/master/examples/1ptracer)

    This example contains a contaminant transported by a base groundwater flow in a randomly distributed permeability field.

 * [Example 2: Two-phase flow with infiltration and adaptive grid:](https://git.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/dumux-repositories/dumux/tree/master/examples/2pinfiltration)

    In this example we model a soil contamination problem where DNAPL infiltrates a porous medium. The initial distribution of DNAPL is known and we can read it from a txt-file. The grid is adapitvely refined around the injection.

 * [Example 3: Shallow water model:](https://git.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/dumux-repositories/dumux/tree/master/examples/shallowwaterfriction)

    This example shows how the shallow water flow model can be applied to simulate steady subcritical flow including bottom friction.
