Installation Instructions
=========================

This file describes how to compile and install DuMuX using DUNE's
standard autotools based build system. If you would like to use the
alternative CMake based build system, please read the file
INSTALL.cmake.

DuMuX is a implemented as an ordinary DUNE module. For a full
explanation of the DUNE installation process, please read the
installation notes on the internet [0]. The following introduction is
meant for the impatient.

Getting started
---------------

In order to compile DuMuX, you first have to download and extract the
following DUNE modules into your source directory:
 
  - DUNE-common      from [1]
  - DUNE-grid        from [1]
  - DUNE-istl        from [1]
  - DUNE-disc        from [3]

Since many simulators of DuMuX use the UG grid manager, you also need
to install it first [4].

Next, you need to decide whether you want to compile in debug or in
optimized mode and adapt the option file for the DUNE build system to
the path where you installed UG. The files are located in
dune-mux/optim.opts and dune-mux/debug.opts respectively. Next,
compile everything using

  ./dune-common/bin/dunecontrol --opts=dune-mux/optim.opts --module=dune-mux all

Finally, install DUNE and DuMuX headers to your system using

  ./dune-common/bin/dunecontrol --module=dune-mux make install

A more comprehensive introduction to the DUNE build system can be
found in [2].
