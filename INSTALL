Installation Instructions
=========================

This file describes how to compile and install DuMuX using DUNE's
standard autotools based build system. If you would like to use the
alternative CMake based build system, please read the file
INSTALL.cmake.

DuMuX is a implemented as an ordinary DUNE module. For a full
explanation of the DUNE installation process, please read the
installation notes on the internet [0]. The following introduction is
meant for the impatient.

Getting started
---------------

In order to compile DuMuX, you first have to download and extract the
following DUNE modules into your source directory:
 
  - dune-common        from [1]
  - dune-grid          from [1]
  - dune-istl          from [1]
  - dune-localfuctions from [1]
  - dune-pdelab        from [2]

Use the 2.0 release of the DUNE core modules and the 2.0 snapshot of 
dune-pdelab. 

Next, you need to decide whether you want to compile in debug or in
optimized mode. Example files are located in $DUMUX_ROOT/optim.opts 
and $DUMUX_ROOT/debug.opts respectively. ($DUMUX_ROOT is the 
directory where the unpacked files of the DuMuX distribution are 
located.) 

Next, compile everything with

  ./dune-common/bin/dunecontrol --opts=$(DUMUX_ROOT)/optim.opts --module=dumux all

Finally, install DUNE and DuMuX headers to your system by

  ./dune-common/bin/dunecontrol --module=dumux make install

A more comprehensive introduction to the DUNE build system can be
found in [3].
