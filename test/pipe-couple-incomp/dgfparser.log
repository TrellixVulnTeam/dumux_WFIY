Step 1 finished: 
                 3d
                 525 verticies
                 320 elements
Using boundarysegments block
Step 2 finished: 
                 352 bnd-segs read in BoundarySegment block
                 352 bnd-segs in grid
                 0 bnd-segs a boundary domain
                 0 bnd-seg assigned default value
                 0 bnd-segs have not been assigned an id!
