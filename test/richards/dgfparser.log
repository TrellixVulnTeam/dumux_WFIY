Step 1 finished: 
                 3d
                 1331 verticies
                 1000 elements
Using boundarysegments block
Step 2 finished: 
                 600 bnd-segs read in BoundarySegment block
                 600 bnd-segs in grid
                 0 bnd-segs a boundary domain
                 0 bnd-seg assigned default value
                 0 bnd-segs have not been assigned an id!
