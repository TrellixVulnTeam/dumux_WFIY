== Running the test cases in test/multidomain ==

Due to the lack of stable versions of the upstream Dune modules
Dune-MultidomainGrid and Dune-Multidomain, we have compatibility
issues with the release version of the Dune Core Modules. You
have to use specific revisions of these, as listed below.

Dune core modules: release 2.3
Dune-PDELab release 1.1
dune-multidomaingrid: release branch 2.3
dune-multidomain Git commit deac3cecfc6697c1f5316d55c0fadd74f51d92bc

Then you have to patch PDELab with the patch from patches/pdelab-1.1.0.patch .

Install the external grid manager UG. Additional you need to install a
direct linear solver like SuperLU or PARDISO.
You need Boost fusion for dune-multidomaingrid.

There are compiler restrictions:
- GCC 4.6 works.
- GCC 4.7 produces segmentation faults.
- GCC 4.8 and 4.9 works only with unoptimized builds (-O0).
- Clang is not supported.
- Intel ICC is not tested.

For your convenience we provide the Shell script installRequiredModules.sh
in the same folder as this README.
