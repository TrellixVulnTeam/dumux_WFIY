What is DUMUX?
==============

DuMuX [0] is a simulation toolbox mainly aimed at flow and transport 
processes in porous media. DuMuX is build on top of the DUNE [1] 
framework and aims to provide a multitude of numerical models as well 
as flexible discretization methods for complex non-linear phenomena, 
such as CO2 sequestration, soil remediation, drug delivery in cancer 
therapy and more. Multi-scale and multi-physics methods are currently 
actively worked on. See [2] for a more detailed description of the 
goals and motivations behind DuMuX.


INSTALLATION
============

There are two ways to install DuMuX: The first is to use the DUNE's
build system, the other is to use CMake. If you just want to evaluate
DuMuX, we recommend to compile DuMuX the DUNE way as outlined in the
INSTALL file. On the other hand, if you would like to develop with
DuMuX, using the CMake based build system has advantages like much
faster configure runs and out-of-tree builds. In this case, follow the
instructions from INSTALL.cmake.
