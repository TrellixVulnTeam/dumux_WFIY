On purpose of this patch directory
----------------------------------
DuMuX is based on a certain release of DUNE 
and some of its components or models can make use of 
external libraries and modules.

Sometimes software like a compiler or a standard library
changes, so it can be useful to adapt these releases in a certain way
that components will seamless work together.
It can also be necessary to fix serious bugs in them, but it makes
not always sense to use a developer version or a more recent release if available.

For fixing such things this directory is made. Files created here contain patches 
against some DUNE release or some other component. Their application should be documented here too.
