- In order to use the AMGBackend, you have to apply the patch pdelab-1.1.0.patch
  inside your DUNE-PDELab 1.1.0 directory by, e.g.,
  patch -p0 <../dumux/patches/pdelab-1.1.0.patch

- If the AMGBackend should be used without SuperLU as coarse grid solver, it can
  be benefitial to decrease the corresponding tolerance. To do so, apply the
  patch istl-2.2.0.patch / istl-2.2.1.patch inside your DUNE-ISTL 2.2.x
  directory by, e.g.,
  patch -p0 <../dumux/patches/istl-2.2.0.patch
  or the patch istl-2.3.0.patch inside your DUNE-ISTL 2.3.x directory by, e.g.,
  patch -p1 <../dumux/patches/istl-2.3.0.patch

- To use DuMuX with Dune-trunk in versions after 2013-03-20 (dune-common r7429)
  m4/dumux.m4 must be patched. This will be done in DuMuX-trunk after the
  Dune 2.3 release. Otherwise dumux-devel and dumux-lecture will not be able
  to find the module DuMuX.
  To patch your local copy inside the dumux folder:
  patch -p0 < ../patches/dumux-m4.patch
