 * \brief Stress-Strain relationship according to Hooke's law
 *
 * Hooke's law describes a linear stress-strain relationship. \n
 * \n
 * \f$\sigma=\mathbf{c}\epsilon\f$
 * with
 * \f$\epsilon=\frac{1}{2}( \; \mathrm{grad}( \mathbf{u})+\mathrm{grad}(\mathbf{u})^T)\f$ \n
 *\n
 * Furthermore, homogeneous and isotropic materials are assumed. \n
 * As proportionality constants the first and second Lam√© parameters are used.\n
 * The final stress-strain relationship yields the following:\n
 * \n
 * \f$ \sigma= 2 \mu \epsilon+\lambda \mathrm{tr}(\epsilon)\mathbf{I} \f$
 * \n
