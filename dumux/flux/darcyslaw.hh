 * \brief
 *
 * Darcy's law describes the advective flux in porous media on the macro-scale and is valid for Reynolds numbers below 1.
 * The advective flux characterizes the bulk flow for each fluid phase including all components in case of compositional flow.
 * It is driven by the potential gradient \f$\textbf{grad}\, p - \varrho {\textbf g}\f$,
 * accounting for both pressure difference and gravitation.
 * The velocity is proportional to the potential gradient with the proportional factor \f$\frac{\textbf K}{\mu}\f$,
 * including the intrinsic permeability of the porous medium, and the viscosity Âµ of the fluid phase. For one-phase flow it is:
 * \f[
 * v = - \frac{\mathbf K}{\mu}
 * \left(\textbf{grad}\, p - \varrho {\mathbf g} \right)
 * \f]
 * This equation can be extended to calculate the velocity \f$v_\alpha\f$ of phase \f$\alpha\f$ in the case of multi-phase
 * flow by considering the relative permeability \f$k_{r\alpha}\f$:
 * \f[
 * v_\alpha = - \frac{k_{r\alpha}}{\mu_\alpha} \mathbf{K}
 * \left(\text{grad}\, p_\alpha - \varrho_{\alpha} \mathbf{g} \right)
 * \f]
 *
 * Darcy's law is specialized for different discretization schemes.
 * This file contains the data which is required to calculate
 * volume and mass fluxes of fluid phases over a face of a finite volume by means
 * of the Darcy approximation. See the corresponding header files for the specific different discretization methods.
