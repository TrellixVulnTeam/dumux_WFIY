 * \brief Adaption of the BOX scheme to the twophase flow model.
 *
 * This model implements two-phase flow of two completely immiscible fluids
 * \f$\alpha \in \{ w, n \}\f$ using a standard multiphase Darcy
 * approach as the equation for the conservation of momentum: 
 \f[
 v_\alpha = - \frac{k_{r\alpha}}{\mu_\alpha} K 
 \left(\text{grad} p_\alpha - \varrho_{\alpha} \boldsymbol{g} \right)
 \f]
 * 
 * By inserting this into the equation for the conservation of the
 * phase mass, one gets
 \f[
 \phi \frac{\partial \varrho_\alpha S_\alpha}{\partial t} 
 - 
 \text{div} \left\{
 \varrho_\alpha \frac{k_{r\alpha}}{\mu_\alpha} K \left(\text{grad} p_\alpha - \varrho_{\alpha} \boldsymbol{g} \right)
 \right\} = q_\alpha \;,
 \f]
 * which is discretized by this model using the fully-coupled vertex
 * centered finite volume (box) scheme as spatial and
 * the implicit Euler method as time discretization.
 *
 * By using constitutive relations for the capillary pressure \f$p_c =
 * p_n - p_w\f$ and relative permability \f$k_{r\alpha}\f$ and taking
 * advantage of the fact that \f$S_w + S_n = 1\f$, the number of
 * unknowns can be reduced to two. Currently the model supports
 * chosing either \f$p_w\f$ and \f$S_n\f$ or \f$p_n\f$ and \f$S_w\f$
 * as primary variables. The formulation which ought to be used can be
 * specified by setting the <tt>Formulation</tt> property to either
 * either <tt>TwoPCommonIndices::pWsN</tt> or <tt>TwoPCommonIndices::pNsW</tt>. By
 * default, the model uses \f$p_w\f$ and \f$S_n\f$.
