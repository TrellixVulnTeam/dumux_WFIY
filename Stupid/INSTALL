We use CMake as our build system. It can be downloaded at
www.cmake.org

After installing cmake on your system make sure that the 'cmake'
executable is in your PATH. To configure the project, run

cmake .

If this was successfull, the project can be build by 

make

You might want to set a few parameters if you didn't install the
required libraries system wide. CMake cache variables can be set using
the "-D" command line switch to 'cmake'. The most important paramerters
are probably:

DUNE_DIR        Path where all DUNE modules have been compiled and can be
                found
DUNE_common_DIR Path where the DUNE-common module can be found. If there 
                is a 'dune-common' subdirectory in $DUNE_DIR, this is not
                required.
(All other DUNE modules are analogous)

BOOST_ROOT        Path BOOST libraries from www.boost.org reside
UG_DIR            Location of the UG grid manager
CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE  Type of build. Either 'debug' or 'release', default is 
                  'release'.

Examples
========

cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debug \
      -DDUNE_DIR=/usr/local/dune \
      -DDUNE_fem_DIR=/usr/local/dune-fem \
      -DBOOST_ROOT=/usr/local/boost \
      -DUG_DIR=/usr/local/ug/
