\section{Spatial Discretization Schemes}
\label{spatialdiscretization}

We discretize space with the cell-centered finite volume method (\ref{cc} ), the box method (\ref{box})
or a staggered grid scheme.
Grid adaption is available for both box and cell-centered finite volume method.
In general, the spatial  parameters, especially the porosity, have to be assigned on
the coarsest level of discretization.

\subsection{Box Method -- A Short Introduction}\label{box}

The so called box method unites the advantages of the finite-volume (FV) and
finite-element (FE) methods.

First, the model domain $\Omega$ is discretized with a FE mesh consisting of nodes
$i$ and corresponding elements $E_k$. Then, a secondary FV mesh is constructed
by connecting the midpoints and barycenters of the elements surrounding node
$i$ creating a box $B_i$ around node $i$ (see Figure \ref{pc:box}a).

\begin{figure} [ht]
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth,keepaspectratio]{png/box_disc.png}
\caption{\label{pc:box} Discretization of the box method}
\end{figure}

The FE mesh divides the box $B_i$ into subcontrolvolumes (scv's) $b^k_i$
(see Figure \ref{pc:box}b). Figure \ref{pc:box}c shows the finite element $E_k$
and the scv's $b^k_i$ inside $E_k$, which belong to four different boxes $B_i$.
Also necessary for the discretization are the faces of the subcontrolvolumes (scvf's)
$e^k_{ij}$ between the scv's $b^k_i$ and $b^k_j$, where $|e^k_{ij}|$ is the length
of the scvf. The integration points $x^k_{ij}$ on $e^k_{ij}$ and the outer normal
vector $\mathbf n^k_{ij}$ are also to be defined (see Figure \ref{pc:box}c).

The advantage of the FE method is that unstructured grids can be used, while the
FV method is mass conservative. The idea is to apply the FV method (balance of
fluxes across the interfaces) to each FV box $B_i$  and to get the fluxes across
the interfaces $e^k_{ij}$ at the integration points $x^k_{ij}$ from the FE approach.
Consequently, at each scvf the following expression results:

\begin{equation}
 	f(\tilde u(x^k_{ij})) \cdot \mathbf n^k_{ij} \: |e^k_{ij}| \qquad \textrm{with}
 	\qquad \tilde u(x^k_{ij}) = \sum_i N_i(x^k_{ij}) \cdot \hat u_i .
\end{equation}

In the following, the discretization of the balance equation is going to be derived.
From the \textsc{Reynolds} transport theorem follows the general balance equation:

\begin{equation}
	\underbrace{\int_\Omega \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \: u \: dx}_{1}
	+ \underbrace{\int_{\partial\Omega} (\mathbf{v} u + \mathbf w) \cdot \textbf n \: d\varGamma}_{2} = \underbrace{\int_\Omega q \: dx}_{3}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	f(u) = \int_\Omega \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} \: dx + \int_{\Omega} \nabla \cdot
	\underbrace{\left[  \mathbf{v} u + \mathbf w(u)\right] }_{F(u)}  \: dx - \int_\Omega q \: dx = 0
\end{equation}
where term 1 describes the changes of entity $u$ within a control volume over
time, term 2 the advective, diffusive and dispersive fluxes over the interfaces
of the control volume and term 3 is the source and sink term. $\Omega$ denotes the
model domain and $F(u) = F(\mathbf v, p) = F(\mathbf v(x,t), p(x,t))$.

Like the FE method, the box method follows the principle of weighted residuals.
In the function $f(u)$ the unknown $u$ is approximated by discrete values at the
nodes of the FE mesh $\hat u_i$ and linear basis functions $N_i$ yielding an
approximate function $f(\tilde u)$. For $u\in \lbrace \mathbf v, p, x^\kappa \rbrace$
this means:

\begin{minipage}[b]{0.47\textwidth}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:p}
	\tilde p = \sum_i N_i \hat{p_i}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:v}
	\tilde{\mathbf v} = \sum_i N_i \hat{\mathbf v}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:x}
	\tilde x^\kappa  = \sum_i N_i \hat x^\kappa
\end{equation}
\end{minipage}
\hfill
\begin{minipage}[b]{0.47\textwidth}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:dp}
	\nabla \tilde p = \sum_i \nabla N_i \hat{p_i}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:dv}
	\nabla \tilde{\mathbf v} = \sum_i \nabla N_i \hat{\mathbf v}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:dx}
	\nabla \tilde x^\kappa  = \sum_i \nabla N_i \hat x^\kappa .
\end{equation}
\end{minipage}

Due to the approximation with node values and basis functions the differential
equations are not exactly fulfilled anymore but a residual $\varepsilon$ is produced.

\begin{equation}
	f(u) = 0  \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad f(\tilde u) = \varepsilon
\end{equation}

Application of the principle of weighted residuals, meaning the multiplication
of the residual $\varepsilon$ with a weighting function $W_j$  and claiming that
this product has to vanish within the whole domain,

\begin{equation}
	\int_\Omega W_j \cdot \varepsilon \: \overset {!}{=} \: 0 \qquad \textrm{with} \qquad \sum_j W_j =1
\end{equation}
yields the following equation:

\begin{equation}
	\int_\Omega W_j \frac{\partial \tilde u}{\partial t} \: dx + \int_\Omega W_j
	\cdot \left[ \nabla \cdot F(\tilde u) \right]  \: dx - \int_\Omega W_j
	\cdot q \: dx = \int_\Omega W_j \cdot \varepsilon \: dx \: \overset {!}{=} \: 0 .
\end{equation}

Then, the chain rule and the \textsc{Green-Gaussian} integral theorem are applied.

\begin{equation}
	\int_\Omega W_j \frac{\partial \sum_i N_i \hat u_i}{\partial t} \: dx
	+ \int_{\partial\Omega}  \left[ W_j \cdot F(\tilde u)\right]
	\cdot \mathbf n \: d\varGamma_\Omega + \int_\Omega  \nabla W_j \cdot F(\tilde u)
	\: dx - \int_\Omega W_j \cdot q \: dx = 0
\end{equation}

A mass lumping technique is applied by assuming that the storage capacity is
reduced to the nodes. This means that the integrals $M_{i,j} = \int_\Omega W_j \: N_i \: dx$
are replaced by the mass lumping term $M^{lump}_{i,j}$ which is defined as:

\begin{equation}
	 M^{lump}_{i,j} =\begin{cases} \int_\Omega W_j \: dx = \int_\Omega N_i \: dx = V_i &i = j\\
	0 &i \neq j\\
	         \end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $V_i$ is the volume of the FV box $B_i$ associated with node $i$.
The application of this assumption in combination with
$\int_\Omega W_j \:q \: dx = V_i \: q$ yields

\begin{equation}
	V_i \frac{\partial \hat u_i}{\partial t}
	+ \int_{\partial\Omega}  \left[ W_j \cdot F(\tilde u)\right]
	\cdot \mathbf n \: d\varGamma_\Omega + \int_\Omega  \nabla W_j \cdot F(\tilde u)
	\: dx- V_i \cdot q = 0 \, .
\end{equation}

Defining the weighting function $W_j$ to be piecewisely constant over a
control volume box $B_i$

\begin{equation}
	W_j(x) = \begin{cases}
	          1 &x \in B_i \\
		  0 &x \notin B_i\\
	         \end{cases}
\end{equation}

causes $\nabla W_j = 0$:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:disc1}
	V_i \frac{\partial \hat u_i}{\partial t}
	+ \int_{\partial B_i}  \left[ W_j \cdot F(\tilde u)\right]
	\cdot \mathbf n  \;  d{\varGamma}_{B_i} - V_i \cdot q = 0 .
\end{equation}

The consideration of the time discretization and inserting $W_j = 1$ finally
leads to the discretized form which will be applied to the mathematical
flow and transport equations:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:discfin}
	V_i \frac{\hat u_i^{n+1} - \hat u_i^{n}}{\Delta t}
	+ \int_{\partial B_i}  F(\tilde u^{n+1}) \cdot \mathbf n
	\;  d{\varGamma}_{B_i} - V_i \: q^{n+1} \: = 0
\end{equation}

\subsection{Cell Centered Finite Volume Method -- A Short Introduction}\label{cc}

\begin{figure} [ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth,keepaspectratio]{png/cc_disc.png}
\caption{\label{pc:cc} Discretization of the cell centered finite volume method}
\end{figure}

The cell centered finite volume method uses the elements of the grid as control volumes.
For each control volume all discrete values are determined at the element/control
volume center (see Figure~\ref{pc:cc}).
The mass or energy fluxes are evaluated at the integration points ($x_{ij}$),
which are located at the midpoints of the control
volume faces. This is a two point flux approximation since the flux between
the element/control volume centers $i$ and $j$ is calculated
only with information from these two points. In contrast the box method uses
a multi-point flux approximation where all nodes of the
element influence the flux between two specific nodes. \\
Neumann boundary conditions are applied at the boundary control volume faces
and Dirichlet boundary conditions at the boundary control volumes. \\
The cell centered finite volume method is robust and mass conservative but
should only be applied for structured grids
(the control volume face normal vector ($n_{ij}$) should be parallel to the
direction of the gradient between the two element/control
volume centers).

\subsection{Staggered Grid -- A Short Introduction}\label{staggered}

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.8\linewidth]{./pdf/staggered_grid.pdf}
\caption{\label{pc:staggered} Discretization of the staggered-grid method. The figure shows the different control volume arrangements, which are staggered with respect to each other. There are the control volumes centered around the scalar primary variables in black, the control volumes located around the $x$-component of the velocity in blue and the control volumes located around the $y$-components of the velocity in red. The control volume boundaries are given by lines. Additionally, there is one shaded example control volume each.\\
In the two-dimensional free-flow models, the continuity equation is discretized using the black control volumes, the $x$-component of the momentum equation is discretized using the blue control volumes and the $y$-component is discretized using the red control volumes. In three dimensions this works analogously.}
\end{figure}

The staggered-grid or marker-and-cell method uses a finite volume method with different control volumes for different equations. There are control volumes centered around the scalar primary variables. They correspond to the finite volume mesh. Additionally, there are control volumes located around the $x,y$ and (in 3D) $z$ velocity components which are shifted in the $x,y$ and $z$ direction, such that the velocity components are located on the edges of the cell-centered finite volume mesh (see Figure~\ref{pc:staggered}). As for the cell-centered method, the fluxes are evaluated at the edges of each control volume with a two-point flux approximation, cf. \ref{cc}.\\
The staggered-grid method is robust, mass conservative, and free of pressure oscillations
but should, as the cell-centered TPFA method, only be applied for structured grids.
Currently, all free-flow models in \Dumux use the staggered-grid discretization.
