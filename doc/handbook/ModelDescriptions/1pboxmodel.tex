Adaption of the BOX scheme to the single phase isothermal flow model. Single phase compressible isothermal flow model, \begin{align*} \phi \frac{\partial \varrho}{\partial t} + \vec{\nabla} \cdot (- \varrho \frac{\bar{\bar{K}}}{\mu} ( \nabla p -\varrho \vec{g})) = q, \end{align*} discretized using a vertex centered finite volume (box) scheme as spatial and the implicit Euler method as time discretization. Of course, the model can also be used for incompressible single phase flow modeling, if in the problem file a fluid with constant density is chosen.
