Single phase isothermal flow model is implemented for compressible flow. \begin{align*} \phi \frac{\partial \varrho}{\partial t} + \vec{\nabla} \cdot (- \varrho \frac{\bar{\bar{K}}}{\mu} ( \nabla p -\varrho \vec{g})) = q \end{align*} However, the model can also be used for incompressible single pahse flow modeling, when in problem file a fluid with constant density is chosen.
