\section{Experience \Dumux by reading -- the \Dumux examples}
As an alternative to going through exercises, you can have a look at our well-documented \Dumux examples. They show how to apply \Dumux to typical physical problems. In the \texttt{README.md} files, the setup is explained, the used code is presented and documented and images resulting from the simulation are included. The \texttt{README.md} files are located directly in the subfolders of \texttt{examples} and can be displayed by web browsers.

We currently have the examples
\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{1ptracer}: one-phase groundwater flow including a tracer
	\item \texttt{2pinfiltration}: two-phase infiltration problem
	\item \texttt{shallowwaterfriction}: steady subcritical shallow water flow including bottom friction  
\end{itemize}
The number of examples is continuously growing.
